“This new area has been applying successfully all the knowledge gathered to improve processes, like power quality monitoring, power system’s protection, power conditioning and synchronization of distributed generators (among others), and the most used digital techniques have been digital filtering, discrete Fourier transform, phased-locked loop tracking methods and more recently, the Kalman filtering (Kalman, 1960).” (P. et al., 2009, p. 397)

“The Kalman filter (KF) was originally proposed to solve a control theoretic problem: considering a linear time-invariant (LTI) system, including state disturbances and measurement errors, how to obtain the best process’ LTI state-estimator (in a stochastic sense, that is, minimizing the covariance of the estimation error), in order to be used in a state feedback control law? In conjunction with optimal linear quadratic regulator, the KF found its first application in the well known LQG control (Linear Quadratic Gaussian). After, it became very popular in other areas, according to (Papoulis, 1991), when people became aware of its desirable properties as an estimator.” (P. et al., 2009, p. 397)

	abstract = {In this paper, a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based approach is proposed for power system frequency estimation. Unlike the existing frequency estimators mainly used for power system monitoring and control, the proposed approach is developed for fundamental frequency estimation in the field of energy metering of nonlinear loads. The characteristics of a nonlinear load is that the power signal is heavily distorted, composed of harmonics, inter-harmonics and corrupted by noise. The main idea is to predetermine a series of frequency points, and the mean value of two frequency points nearest to the power system frequency is accepted as the approximate solution. Firstly the input signal is modulated with a series of modulating signals, whose frequencies are those frequency points. Then the modulated signals are decomposed into individual frequency bands using DWT, and differences between the maximum and minimum wavelet coefficients in the lowest frequency band are calculated. Similarities among power system frequency and those frequency points are judged by the differences. Simulation results have proven high immunity to noise, harmonic and inter-harmonic interferences. The proposed method is applicable for real-time power system frequency estimation for electric energy measurement of nonlinear loads.},

In this context, estimating the phase and frequency of the grid voltage signal is an interesting problem. Out of various techniques available in the literature, Linear Kalman Filter (LKF) is one of the most popular one. In this paper, we propose an alternative implementation of the LKF for grid synchronization application. The proposed implementation uses a linear parametric model of the grid voltage signal including DC offset. It does not involve any quadrature signal generation, rather it works by estimating the phase angle. This helps to estimate the unknown grid frequency directly from the phase angle. This clearly differentiates the proposed alternative implementation with respect to the existing implementations. Performance improvement by the proposed technique is veriﬁed extensively through comparative numerical simulation and experimental studies. Comparative results demonstrate the suitability of the proposed technique with respect to other state-of-the-art techniques namely SecondOrder Generalized Integrator Phase-Locked Loop (SOGI-PLL) and Enhanced Phase-Locked Loop (EPLL).},

Therefore this paper presents a new phase-locked loop for the estimation of time-dependent frequencies in unbalanced power systems with harmonics. The proposed frequency estimation method consists of two signal processing steps: In the ﬁrst step, a least mean square estimator reconstructs the fundamental sinusoidal signal from the measured three-phase grid voltage and splits it into positive, negative and zero sequence components. In the second step, the resulting ﬁrst harmonic three-phase positive sequence is converted into the synchronous reference frame in the form of a phase-locked loop using a state feedback controller scheme to reconstruct the current grid frequency. Here the controller output is equivalent to the signal to be reconstructed. The feedback controller design is based on linear matrix inequalities where the requirements are explicitly considered. The capability of proposed state feedback phase-locked loop is demonstrated by full scaled electro magnetic transient simulations.},

Numerous frequency estimation techniques have been proposed, which are based on parameterization of deterministic signal models. Cautions should be taken since uncertainties such as noise are common in raw waveform measurements, and will propagate into estimation results. In order to mitigate the adverse impact of measurement noise, most recently, Kalman filter-based approaches were promoted, and are giving promising results. Nevertheless, conventional Kalman filter or extended Kalman filter have limited performance due to the high nonlinearity of the underlying state equations. In order to adapt to nonlinearity, this paper proposed a technique that leverages the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). The paper also introduces an approach that employs three-phase measurements to improve the overall frequency estimation accuracy. Simulation results show that the proposed UKF-based approach achieves extremely high fundamental frequency calculation accuracy despite severe noise interference.},

Greater autonomous capability means there is a need for high-performance state estimation. However, the desire to reduce costs through simplified development processes and compact form factors can limit performance. A hardware-based approach, such as using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), is common when high performance is required, but hardware approaches tend to have a more complicated development process when compared to traditional software approaches; greater development complexity, in turn, results in higher costs. Leveraging the advantages of both hardware-based and softwarebased approaches, a hardware/software (HW/SW) codesign of the unscented Kalman filter (UKF), based on an FPGA, is presented. The UKF is split into an application-specific part, implemented in software to simplify the development process, and a non-application-specific part, implemented in hardware as a parameterisable ‘black box’ module (i.e. IP core) to increase performance. Simulation results demonstrating a possible nanosatellite application of the design are presented; implementation (synthesis, timing, power) details are also presented.},

In this paper, we utilize the inverse power method to find a TLS estimate of the parameters of the assumed widely-linear predictive model in an adaptive fashion. Simulation results show that the resultant algorithm, called augmented inverse power iterations (AIPI), outperforms the recently proposed augmented complex Kalman filter (ACKF) and augmented complex extended Kalman filter (ACEKF) algorithms in estimating the frequency of the three-phase power systems.

	abstract = {The document discusses the political and economic factors influencing agricultural research, particularly the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen, in the early 20th century. Self-sufficiency as a political philosophy gained varying degrees of support across countries, leading to an emphasis on intensive agriculture, which relies on cheap nitrogen supply. This, in turn, spurred research into biological and artificial nitrogen fixation methods.

The document highlights how scientific achievements during World War I boosted public support for scientific research, even in financially struggling countries. However, this support waned during the economic depression, leading to reduced funding for research, especially in fields directly related to production.

The literature on nitrogen fixation by leguminous plants shows a significant correlation with economic conditions, mirroring trends in stock markets. The research output was sensitive to political and economic upheavals, reflecting in peaks and valleys in publication rates. The study includes a mathematical model (logistic curve) to describe the growth of scientific literature on this topic, but real-world data shows deviations due to external factors like wars, economic conditions, and influential scientific leaders.

The analysis concludes that, despite fluctuations, the field of nitrogen fixation by leguminous plants will likely reach a steady state of around 100 publications per year by 1965-1970, with an annual literature volume of 1,500 to 1,600 pages. The document suggests that to make accurate predictions, future research must account for external influences on scientific output.},

(“Bibliometric Indicators and Analysis of Research Systems: Methods and Examples”, 1997, p. 6)
"Subsequently, Lotka (1926) showed the distribution frequencies of scientific production. He was undoubtedly one of the first to link the notion of productivity to counting, using the decennial indices of Chemical Abstracts and Auerbach’s Geschichtstafeln der Physik." (“Bibliometric Indicators and Analysis of Research Systems: Methods and Examples”, 1997, p. 10)
"Lotka noted that the number of published papers was not distributed uniformly, and that productivity tended to be concentrated among a limited number of researchers." (“Bibliometric Indicators and Analysis of Research Systems: Methods and Examples”, 1997, p. 10)

	abstract = {The present paper explores the amount of research activity estimated through the growth of scientific literature in the field of parents’ participation in their childrens’ schooling: it is a so-called bibliometric analysis. Assessing the “size of science” is a complex task, but bibliometric techniques have been shown to be useful in the development of scientific research activity to address emerging concerns such as the rate of development of a certain discipline and of some specific areas of scientific interest (Katz \& Hicks, 1997).Data for analysis were collected from several relevant queries restricted to articles accessible through Cambridge Scientific Abstract (C.S.A.) on-line research platform. Nearly 11,000 bibliographic records were retrieved, with publication dates ranging from 1966 to 2005.In this study researchers attempted to answer two main research questions: which is the rate of literature growth in the field of parent participation (and the expected rate for the forthcoming years)? Which are the different patterns of literature production through different research fields (Pedagogy,Psychology, Sociology, etc.)?Our results reveal a strong growth rate in the number of articles published, and rather significant differences in the various disciplines taken into consideration.},

Two major categories of indicators are (1) quantitative indicators that measure the research productivity of a researcher and (2) performance indicators that evaluate the quality of publications. Bibliometric indicators are important for both the individual researcher and organizations. They are widely used to compare the performance of the individual researchers, journals and universities. Many of the appointments, promotions and allocation of research funds are based on these indicators. This review article describes some of the currently used bibliometric indicators such as journal impact factor, crown indicator, h-index and it’s variants. It is suggested that for comparison of scientific impact and scientific output of researchers due consideration should be given to various factors affecting theses indicators.},

The histories of scientiﬁc development of groups of countries are compared, seeking to understand the causes and circumstances that led to some dynamic response. We were able to identify dynamical changes that affected global scientiﬁc production. Our analysis identiﬁed instances where global production was inﬂuenced by social, political and economic circumstances. The role of the most productive countries in the current dynamics of knowledge production is also studied. We obtained a vector auto regressive model that describes their joint inﬂuences. Thus, the effect of changes in the production of one country on the production of the others can be assessed. The results indicate that the USA and the United Kingdom are still the most inﬂuential countries in science, despite the fast growth of China’s production.},

For instance, what value should be given to a two-author or threeauthor publication with respect to a single-author publication? This paper uses axiomatic analysis and proposes a practical method to compute the expected value of an n-authors publication that takes into consideration the added value induced by collaboration in contexts in which there is no prior or ex-ante information about the publication’s potential merits or scientiﬁc impact. The only information required is the number of authors. We compared the obtained theoretical values with the empirical values based on a large dataset from the Web of Science database. We found that the theoretical values are very close to the empirical values for some disciplines, but not for all. This observation provides support in favor of the method proposed in this paper. We expect that our ﬁndings can help researchers and decisionmakers to choose more eﬀective and fair counting methods that take into account the beneﬁts of collaboration.},

The study is justified by the need to deepen the relationship between investment in R\&D and economic growth, and was conducted for developed and emerging countries separately, so that the understanding of which countries or regions’ investment in R\&D and its consequent scientific production has the greatest impact over the size of their economies through innovation. Our findings indicate clearly that R\&D investment strongly correlates to the economy’s size of the studied countries. In addition to finding our novel indicator statistically significant with respect to economic growth through a series of multiple linear regressions and proposing economic growth not statically, but as a dynamic cumulative effect over time, this becomes more relevant for emerging countries (represented in this study by China, Brazil, India, Russia and Turkey, or BRIC + Turkey) compared to developed ones, which decants into an opportunity for scholars and particularly governments to design or restructure their R\&D policies towards innovation.},

	abstract = {Time series models are developed for predicting future values of a variable that when cumulated is subject to an unknown saturation level. Such models are relevant for many disciplines, but here attention is focused on the spread of epidemics and the applications are for coronavirus. The time series models are relatively simple but are such that their specification can be assessed by standard statistical test procedures. In the generalized logistic class of models, the logarithm of the growth rate of the cumulative series depends on a time trend. Allowing this trend to be time-varying introduces further flexibility and enables the effects of changes in policy to be tracked and evaluated.},
